# Project Name
RL-Minority-game-code

## Project Description
This project provides basic code for paper "Optimal coordination of resource: A solution from reinforcement learning", enabling users to reproduce the relevant results presented in the article. The program can be utilized to explore resource coordination issues, as discussed in the aforementioned paper.

## Installation Guide
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your computer.
2. Download the project code.
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
4. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o MG MG.cpp
5. Run the program:
./MG

## Usage Example
After running the program, you will generate a text file named time_series_tau=0.1.txt, which contains the time series data of actions and variance. For example, setting the temperature to tau = 0.5 will yield results for Figure 1c in the article. Users can modify the temperature and time window parameters as needed.
